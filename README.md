# worldcup_data_analysis

In this project I analize data from all World Cups from 1930 until 2014. The dataset used "WorldCupMatches.csv" contains a list of all matches played in all those world cups. With this dataset I've tried to asnwer the following questions:

## PROBLEM 1
* Winner, Runners-up, Third and Fourth ranked team of the World Cup
* Total goals scored at the World Cup
* Number of qualified teams for the World Cup
* Number of matches played during the World Cup
* Total attendance of the World Cup


## PROBLEM 2
* Can any correlation be found between referees and countries that participated in the all World Cups?
* Try to estimate total revenue of each World Cup, based only on attendance.
* Is there any correlation between number of goals scored per game and altitude of the stadium which hosted the game?
* Provide list of top five teams which scored most of the goals per World Cup, ranked from the one which scored the most of the goals, to the one which scored the least number of goals.
* Can any connection be found between datetime of the game played and number of goals scored during the game?

## PROBLEM 3 (Extra)
* The role to tradition in World Cups
